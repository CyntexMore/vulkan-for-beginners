This guide follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) to ensure that developers can easily understand the changes made to the API and how they may affect their applications. The versioning scheme consists of three numbers: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. A new codename (such as "Vega" for v1.0) is assigned to each `.MINOR` release to provide a more memorable reference for developers.
