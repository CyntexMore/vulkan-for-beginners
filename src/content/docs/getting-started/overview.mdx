This guide doesn't expect that you have a PhD in math, you've read ten books about graphics programming, or that you've used [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) before. While these are nice-to-haves, they aren't expected from you. While this isn't a requirement either, a previous background with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a nice to have, just to have a mental model of 3D perspective. If you feel like you already understand it, no need to tap into it. We won't be using any highly advanced C++ features, but a basic knowledge about <Hover term="class" client:visible />es and <Hover term="RAII" client:visible /> is only benefitial. If you feel like you don't understand C++ enough, it is highly recommended that you check out [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/).

In this guide, we will build a solar system simulation in Vulkan. An ambitious, but every achieveable goal.

## What will we be using?

:::note
Don't worry, you won't be setting anything up yet. That's for the next chapter, just lean back and read for now.
:::

Vulkan is both modern and outdated at the same time. By this, I mean that the original C API is... very ancient, but Vulkan itself is "modern" in a sense (features, etc.).

There are a lot of ways to write Vulkan. There are bindings for a ton of languages, such as Zig, Rust, Golang, so on. But we are going to do this the "original way." In the future, this guide might include multi-lingual examples in the future to lean into that "Vulkan for everyone" agenda.

To somewhat mitigate this, we will be using the [Vulkan-Hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp) wrapper. It makes the initialization and boilerplate less of a hassle, and it includes proper C++ classes and <Hover term="RAII" client:visible />. At least C++17 is required to use Vulkan-Hpp, so we'll be using exactly that for maximum compatibility and to avoid niche C++20 functions (that the official Vulkan guide introduces...). Vulkan-Hpp is part of the [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) since version 1.0.24.

For our build system, I went with [CMake](https://cmake.org/). I know, it's the devil, but it's still the best cross-platform solution we have. Don't worry, I'll provide a coherent `CMakeLists.txt` file in the next chapter that works on multiple systems, and I'll note if you have to change anything.

Since Vulkan can't account for all windowing systems all at once, we need something that does. For this, we will be using [GLFW3](https://www.glfw.org/), the OpenGL windowing library. Even though it's originally made for OpenGL, Vulkan support has been added over the years. Alternatives exist, but we won't be exploring any. And I won't list any of them, to avoid confusing the reader.

We also need something to do the math. For this, we'll be using [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (Open**GL** **M**athematics). Again, don't let the name confuse you, as it works perfectly with Vulkan, too.
